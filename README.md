Four   projects   (60%),   one   written   exam   (40%)

## Course overview

This course aims at presenting the modern techniques of large set of data   analysis   and   at   developing   basic   tools   for   data   mining.
The class aims at providing the students with the main theory under the hood of data mining and machine learning. The first part relates to exploratory data analysis, the approach where students analyze data sets using visual tools (plots, charts) and methods (Principal Component Analysis) to summarize their main characteristics and visualize relatedness and distance between populations . The  second part concerns unsupervised and supervised learning, with pattern detection methods. Students will learn Bayesian theory, linear, quadratic regression and decisions trees with the implementation of the related loss functions and classifiers. Hence students will see different machine learning models and know how to choose the most robust   or   efficient   model      based   on   the   data   distribution   and   nature.
In a nutshell, students will be able to describe the sense and information big volumes of data carry   and   justify   the   use   of   a   particular   method   in   real   application.


## Projects   Description
All   the   projects   are   implemented   with   R.2017-2018


# ● Project 1
Descriptive statistics and Principal Component Analysis: Basic analysis of datasets with R, correlation determination and factors influence; manual application of the   PCA,   then   use   of   R   tools   to   apply   it   on   different   datasets.
# ● Project 2 Automatic Classification: Data visualization via AFTD (Analyse Factorielle d’un Tableau de Distances
Factorial Analysis of a Distances Table), to show that this leads to the same results as a PCA; Hierarchical Classification; K-means   implementation.
# ● Project 3 
Discrimination, bayesian theory of decision: Implementation of Euclidian classifier, KNN algorithm with performance evaluation; Work on Bayes Rule with comparison   between   theoretical   and   practical   results.
# ● Project 4
Discrimination: Implementation of Discriminant function analysis (linear, quadratic, and naive bayesian classifier), Logistic regression (linear and quadratic); Use   of   Decision   Tree   libraries   and   test   on   real   data.
